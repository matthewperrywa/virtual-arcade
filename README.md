Submission for University of Washington Bothell's 2022 hackathon.

Virtual Arcade is an arcade cabinet with 3 playable games: Pong, Snake, and a container game.

Pong is a 2 player game with a goal of hitting the ball past the other player's paddle.<br />Snake is a single player game with a goal of eating as much of the fruit as possible.<br />The goal of the container game is to get all of the shapes in the containers.

Hackathon Information (Entertainment Track):

1. My goals of the project were to create a fun videogame website and improve my JavaScript skills.
2. I want the user experience to be smooth and easy for users to understand the games without requiring much text. I incorporated a minimalistic approach in my design to achieve this.
3. The project is made almost entirely with JavaScript. I used CSS to maintain the same style across different pages.
4. An issue I encountered was that I was struggling to make the style of the games more unique. If I had more time, I would have liked to give a bit more personal flair to the graphics of the games. One feature I could have added to achieve this would be a dark mode or other color palette options.
