Submission for University of Washington Bothell's 2022 hackathon.

Virtual arcade cabinet with 3 playable games: Pong, Snake, and a container game.

Pong is a 2 player game with a goal of hitting the ball past the other player's paddle. Snake is a single player game with a goal of eating as much of the fruit as possible. The goal of the container game is to get all of the shapes in the containers.
